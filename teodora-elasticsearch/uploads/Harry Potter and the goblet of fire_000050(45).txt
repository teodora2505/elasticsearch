Uncle Vernon gave a great sigh, which ruffled his large, bushy mustache, and picked up his spoon.
The doorbell rang.  Uncle Vernon heaved himself out of his chair and set off down the hall.  Quick as a flash, while his mother was occupied with the kettle, Dudley stole the rest of Uncle Vernon's grapefruit.
Harry heard talking at the door, and someone laughing, and Uncle Vernon answering curtly.  Then the front door closed, and the sound of ripping paper came from the hall.
Aunt Petunia set the teapot down on the table and looked curiously around to see where Uncle Vernon had got to.  She didn't have to wait long to find out; after about a minute, he was back.  He looked livid.
"You," he barked at Harry.  "In the living room.  Now."
Bewildered, wondering what on earth he was supposed to have done this time, Harry got up and followed Uncle Vernon out of the kitchen and into the next room.  Uncle Vernon closed the door sharply behind both of them.
