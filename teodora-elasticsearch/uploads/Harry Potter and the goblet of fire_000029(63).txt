	Frank turned his right ear toward the door, the better to hear.  There came the clink of a bottle being put down upon some hard surface, and then the dull scraping noise of a heavy chair being dragged across the floor.  Frank caught a glimpse of a small man, his back to the door, pushing the chair into place.  He was wearing a long black cloak, and there was a bald patch at the back of his head.  Then he went out of sight again.
	"Where is Nagini?" said the cold voice.
	"I -- I don't know, My Lord," said the first voice nervously.  "She set out to explore the house, I think..."
	"You will milk her before we retire, Wormtail," said the second voice.  "I will need feeding in the night.  The journey has tired me greatly."
	Brow furrowed, Frank inclined his good ear still closer to the door, listening very hard.  There was a pause, and then the man called Wormtail spoke again.
	"My Lord, may I ask how long we are going to stay here?"
