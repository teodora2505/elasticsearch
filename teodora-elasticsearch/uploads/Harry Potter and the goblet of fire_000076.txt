He and Ron exchanged glances and then quickly looked away from each other; the temptation to burst out laughing was almost overwhelming.  Dudley was still clutching his bottom as though afraid it might fall off.  Mr. Weasley, however, seemed genuinely concerned at Dudley's peculiar behavior.  Indeed, from the tone of his voice when he next spoke, Harry was quite sure that Mr. Weasley thought Dudley was quite as mad as the Dursleys thought he was, except that Mr. Weasley felt sympathy rather than fear.
"Having a good holiday, Dudley?" he said kindly.
Dudley whimpered.  Harry saw his hands tighten still harder over his massive backside.
Fred and George came back into the room carrying Harry's school trunk.  They glanced around as they entered and spotted Dudley.  Their faces cracked into identical evil grins.
"Ah, right," said Mr. Weasley.  "Better get cracking then."
He pushed up the sleeves of his robes and took out his wand.  Harry saw the Dursleys draw back against the wall as one.
