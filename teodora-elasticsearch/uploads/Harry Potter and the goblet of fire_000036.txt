	"We could have modified her memory?  But Memory Charms can be broken by a powerful wizard, as I proved when I questioned her.  It would be an insult to her memory not to use the information I extracted from her, Wormtail."
	Out in the corridor, Frank suddenly became aware that the hand gripping his walking stick was slippery with sweat.  The man with the cold voice had killed a woman.  He was talking about it without any kind of remorse -- with amusement.  He was dangerous -- a madman.  And he was planning more murders -- this boy, Harry Potter, whoever he was -- was in danger --
	Frank knew what he must do.  Now, if ever, was the time to go to the police.  He would creep out of the house and head straight for the telephone box in the village...but the cold voice was speaking again, and Frank remained where he was, frozen to the spot, listening with all his might.
	"One more murder...my faithful servant at Hogwarts...Harry Potter is as good as mine, Wormtail.  It is decided.  There will be no more argument.  But quiet...I think I hear Nagini..."
	And the second man's voice changed.  He started making noises such as Frank had never heard before; he was hissing and spitting without drawing breath.  Frank thought he must be having some sort of fit or seizure.
	And then Frank heard movement behind him in the dark passageway.  He turned to look, and found himself paralyzed with fright.
