Ginny, who was huddled in her corner looking nearly as bad as Harry

"But didn't any of you -- fall off your seats?" said Harry awkwardly.

"No," said Ron, looking anxiously at Harry again. "Ginny was shaking
like mad, though...."

recovering from a bad bout of flu; he also felt the beginnings of shame.
