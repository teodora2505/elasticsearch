Uncle Vernon was perusing the letter again.
"Quidditch," he muttered under his breath. "Quidditch - what is this rubbish?"
Harry felt a second stab of annoyance.
"It's a sport," he said shortly. "Played on broom- "
"All right, all right!"  said Uncle Vernon loudly.  Harry saw, with some satisfaction, that his uncle looked vaguely panicky.  Apparently his nerves couldn't stand the sound of the word "broomsticks" in his living room.  He took refuge in perusing the letter again.  Harry saw his lips form the words "send us your answer ... in the normal way."  He scowled.
"What does she mean, 'the normal way'?"  he spat.
