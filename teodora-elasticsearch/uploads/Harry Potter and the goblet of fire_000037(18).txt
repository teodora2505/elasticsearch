	Something was slithering toward him along the dark corridor floor, and as it drew nearer to the sliver of firelight, he realized with a thrill of terror that it was a gigantic snake, at least twelve feet long.  Horrified, transfixed, Frank stared as its undulating body cut a wide, curving track through the thick dust on the floor, coming closer and closer -- What was he to do?  The only means of escape was into the room where the two men sat plotting murder, yet if he stayed where he was the snake would surely kill him --
	But before he had made his decision, the snake was level with him, and then, incredibly, miraculously, it was passing; it was following the spitting, hissing noises made by the cold voice beyond the door, and in seconds, the tip of its diamond-patterned tail had vanished through the gap.
	There was sweat on Frank's forehead now, and the hand on the walking stick was trembling.  Inside the room, the cold voice was continuing to hiss, and Frank was visited by a strange idea, an impossible idea...This man could talk to snakes.
	Frank didn't understand what was going on.  He wanted more than anything to be back in his bed with his hot-water bottle.  The problem was that his legs didn't seem to want to move.  As he stood there shaking and trying to master himself, the cold voice switched abruptly to English again.
	"Nagini has interesting news, Wormtail," it said.
	"In-indeed, My Lord?"  said Wormtail.
