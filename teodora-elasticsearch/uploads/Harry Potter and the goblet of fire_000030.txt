	"A week," said the cold voice.  "Perhapse longer.  The place is moderately comfortable, and the plan cannot proceed yet.  It would be foolish to act before the Quidditch World Cup is over."
	Frank inserted a gnarled finger into his ear and rotated it.  Owing, no doubt, to a buildup of earwax, he had heard the word "Quidditch," which was not a word at all.
	"The -- the Quidditch World Cup, My Lord?" said Wormtail.  (Frank dug his finger still more vigorously into his ear.)  "Forgive me, but -- I do not understand -- why should we wait until the World Cup is over?"
	"Because, fool, at this very moment wizards are pouring into the country from all over the world, and every meddler from the Ministry of Magic will be on duty, on the watch for signs of ususual activity, checking and double-checking identities.  They will be obsessed with security, lest the Muggles notice anything.  So we wait."
	Frank stopped trying to clear out his ear.  He had distinctly heard the words "Ministry of Magic," "wizards," and "Muggles."  Plainly, each of these expressions meant something secret, and Frank could think of only two sorts of people who would speak in code:  spies and criminals.  Frank tightened his hold on his walking stick once more, and listened more closely still.
	"Your Lordship is still determined, then?"  Wormtail said quietly.
