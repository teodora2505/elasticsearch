�Dinky Duddydums, don�t cry, Mummy won�t let him 
spoil your special day!� she cried, flinging her arms 
around him. 

�I ... don�t ... want ... him ... t-t-to come!� Dudley 
yelled between huge, pretend sobs. �He always sp- 
spoils everything!� He shot Harry a nasty grin through 
the gap in his mothers arms. 

Just then, the doorbell rang � �Oh, good Lord, 
they�re here!� said Aunt Petunia frantically � and a 
moment later, Dudley�s best friend, Piers Polkiss, 
walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy 
with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who 
held people�s arms behind their backs while Dudley 
hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once.
