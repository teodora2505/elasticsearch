	"Liar," said the second voice again, the cruel amusement more pronounced than ever.  "However, I do not deny that her information was invaluable.  Without it, I could never have formed our plan, and for that, you will have your reward, Wormtail.  I will allow you to perform an essential task for me, one that many of my followers would give their right hands to perform..."
	"R-really, My Lord?  What -- ?"  Wormtail sounded terrified again.
	"Ah, Wormtail, you don't want me to spoil the surprise?  Your part will come at the very end...but I promise you, you will have the honor of being just as useful as Bertha Jorkins."
	"You...you..."  Wormtail's voice suddenly sounded hoarse, as though his mouth had gone very dry.  "You...are going...to kill me too?"
	"Wormtail, Wormtail," said the cold voice silkily, "why would I kill you?  I killed Bertha because I had to.  She was fit for nothing after my questioning, quite useless.  In any case, awkward questions would have been asked if she had gone back to the Ministry with the news that she had met you on her holidays.  Wizards who are supposed to be dead would do well not to run into Ministry of Magic witches at wayside inns..."
	Wormtail muttered something so quietly that Frank could not hear it, but it made the second man laugh -- an entirely mirthless laugh, cold as his speech.
