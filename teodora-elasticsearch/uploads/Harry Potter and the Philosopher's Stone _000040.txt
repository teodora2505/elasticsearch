�Well,� said Dumbledore finally, �that�s that. We�ve no 
business staying here. We may as well go and join the 
celebrations.� 

�Yeah,� said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, �I�d best 
get this bike away. G �night, Professor McGonagall � 
Professor Dumbledore, sir.� 

Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid 
swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the 
engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off 
into the night. 

�I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,� 
said Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor 
McGonagall blew her nose in reply.
