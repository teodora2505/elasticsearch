�Owls . . . shooting stars . . . and there were a lot of 
funny-looking people in town today ...� 

�So?� snapped Mrs. Dursley. 

�Well, I just thought ... maybe ... it was something to 
do with ... you know ... her crowd.� 

Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. 
Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he�d 
heard the name �Potter.� He decided he didn�t dare. 
Instead he said, as casually as he could, �Their son � 
he�d be about Dudley�s age now, wouldn�t he?� 

�I suppose so,� said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.
