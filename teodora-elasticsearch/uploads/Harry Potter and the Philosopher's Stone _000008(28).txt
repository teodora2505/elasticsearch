�The Potters, that�s right, that�s what I heard � � 

� � yes, their son, Harry � � 

Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He 
looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say 
something to them, but thought better of it. 

He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his 
office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, 
seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing 
his home number when he changed his mind. He put 
the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, 
thinking ... no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn�t 
such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots 
of people called Potter who had a son called Harry.
