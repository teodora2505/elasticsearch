�Where�s my letter?� said Harry, the moment Uncle 
Vernon had squeezed through the door. �Who�s 
writing to me?� 

�No one. It was addressed to you by mistake,� said 
Uncle Vernon shortly. �I have burned it.� 

�It was not a mistake,� said Harry angrily, �it had my 
cupboard on it.� 

�SILENCE!� yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of 
spiders fell from the ceiling. He took a few deep 
breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which 
looked quite painful.
