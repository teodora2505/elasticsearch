	The front door of the Riddle House bore no sign of being forced, nor did any of the windows.  Frank limped around to the back of the house until he reached a door almost completely hidden by ivy, took out the old key, put it into the lock, and opened the door noiselessly.
	He let himself into the cavernous kitchen.  Frank had not entered it for many years; nevertheless, although it was very dark, he remembered where the door into the hall was, and he groped his way towards it, his nostrils full of the smell of decay, ears pricked for any sound of footsteps or voices from overhead.  He reached the hall, which was a little lighter owing to the large mullioned windows on either side of the front door, and started to climb the stairs, blessing the dust that lay thick upon the stone, because it muffled the sound of his feet and stick.
	On the landing, Frank turned right, and saw at once where the intruders were:  At the every end of the passage a door stood ajar, and a flickering light shone through the gap, casting a long sliver of gold across the black floor.  Frank edged closer and closer, he was able to see a narrow slice of the room beyond.
	The fire, he now saw, had been lit in the grate.  This surprised him.  Then he stopped moving and listened intently, for a man's voice spoke within the room; it sounded timid and fearful.
	"There is a little more in the bottle, My Lord, if you are still hungry."
	"Later," said a second voice.  This too belonged to a man -- but it was strangely high-pitched, and cold as a sudden blast of icy wind.  Something about that voice made the sparse hairs on the back of Frank's neck stand up.  "Move me closer to the fire, Wormtail."
