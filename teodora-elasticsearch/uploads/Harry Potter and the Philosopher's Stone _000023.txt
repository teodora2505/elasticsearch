�Oh yes, everyone�s celebrating, all right,� she said 
impatiently. �You�d think they�d be a bit more careful, 
but no � even the Muggles have noticed something�s 
going on. It was on their news.� She jerked her head 
back at the Dursleys� dark living-room window. �I 
heard it. Flocks of owls ... shooting stars. ... Well, 
they�re not completely stupid. They were bound to 
notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent � I�ll 
bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much 
sense.� 

�You can�t blame them,� said Dumbledore gently. 
�We�ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven 
years.� 

�I know that,� said Professor McGonagall irritably.
