�Darling, you haven�t counted Auntie Marge�s present, 
see, it�s here under this big one from Mommy and 
Daddy.� 

�All right, thirty-seven then,� said Dudley, going red 
in the face. Harry, who could see a huge Dudley 
tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as 
fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over. 

Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because 
she said quickly, �And we�ll buy you another two 
presents while we�re out today. How�s that, popkin? 
Two more presents. Is that all right?�
