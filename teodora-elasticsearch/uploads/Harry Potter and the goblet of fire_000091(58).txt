"Because he's being stupid," said Ginny, "Its proper name is Pigwidgeon."
"Yeah, and that's not a stupid name at all," said Ron sarcastically.  "Ginny named him," he explained to Harry.  "She reckons it's sweet.  And I tried to change it, but it was too late, he won't answer to anything else.  So now he's Pig.  I've got to keep him up here because he annoys Errol and Hermes.  He annoys me too, come to that.
Pigwidgeon zoomed happily around his cage, hooting shrilly.  Harry knew Ron too well to take him seriously.  He had moaned continually about his old rat, Scabbers, but had been most upset when Hermione's cat, Crookshanks, appeared to have eaten him.
"Where's Crookshanks?" Harry asked Hermione now.
"Out in the garden, I expect," she said. "He likes chasing gnomes.  He's never seen any before."
"Percy's enjoying work, then?"  said Harry, sitting down on one of the beds and watching the Chudley Cannons zooming in and out of the posters on the ceiling.
