Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle 
Vernon held it high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia 
took it curiously and read the first line. For a moment 
it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her 
throat and made a choking noise. 

�Vernon! Oh my goodness � Vernon!� 

They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten 
that Harry and Dudley were still in the room. Dudley 
wasn�t used to being ignored. He gave his father a 
sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick. 

�I want to read that letter,� he said loudly. 

�I want to read it,� said Harry furiously, �as it�s mine.�
