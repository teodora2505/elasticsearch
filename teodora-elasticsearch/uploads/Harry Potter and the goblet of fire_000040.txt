	"Is that right?"  said Frank roughly.  "Lord, is it?  Well, I don't think much of your manners, My Lord.  Turn 'round and face me like a man, why don't you?"
	"But I am not a man, Muggle," said the cold voice, barely audible now over the crackling of the flames.  "I am much, much more than a man.  However...why not?  I will face you...Wormtail, come turn my chair around."
	The servant gave a whimper.
	"You heard me, Wormtail."
	Slowly, with his face screwed up, as though he would rather have done anything than approach his master and the hearth rug where the snake lay, the small man walked forward and began to turn the chair.  The snake lifted its ugly triangular head and hissed slightly as the legs of the chair snagged on its rug.
	And then the chair was facing Frank, and he saw what was sitting in it.  His walking stick fell to the floor with a clatter.  He opened his mouth and let out a scream.  He was screaming so loudly that he never heard the words the thing in the chair spoke as it raised a wand.  There was a flash of green light, a rushing sound, and Frank Bryce crumpled.  He was dead before he hit the floor.
